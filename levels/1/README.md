# Level 1

Excellent, you are now on Level 1, the Guessing Game. All you
have to do is guess the combination correctly, and you'll be given
the password to access Level 2! We've been assured that this level
has no security vulnerabilities in it (and the machine running the
Guessing Game has no outbound network connectivity, meaning you
wouldn't be able to extract the password anyway), so you'll probably
just have to try all the possible combinations. Or will you...?

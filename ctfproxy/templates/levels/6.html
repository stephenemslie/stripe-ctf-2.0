<p>
  After Karma Trader from Level 4 was hit with massive karma inflation
  (purportedly due to someone flooding the market with massive quantities of
  karma), the site had to close its doors. All hope was not lost, however, since
  the technology was acquired by a real up-and-comer, Streamer. Streamer is the
  self-proclaimed most steamlined way of sharing updates with your friends.
</p>

<p>
  The Streamer engineers, realizing that security holes had led to the demise of
  Karma Trader, have greatly beefed up the security of their application. Which
  is really too bad, because you've learned that the holder of the password to
  access Level 7, `level07-password-holder`, is the first Streamer user.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, `level07-password-holder` is taking a lot of precautions: his or
  her computer has no network access besides the Streamer server itself, and his
  or her password is a complicated mess, including quotes and apostrophes and the
  like.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately for you, the Streamer engineers have decided to open-source their
  application so that other people can run their own Streamer instances.

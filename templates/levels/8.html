  Welcome to the final level, Level 8.
</p>

<p>
  HINT 1: No, really, we're not looking for a timing attack.
</p>

<p>
  HINT 2: Running the server locally is probably a good place to start. Anything
  interesting in the output?
</p>

<p>
  Because password theft has become such a rampant problem, a security firm has
  decided to create PasswordDB, a new and secure way of storing and validating
  passwords. You've recently learned that the Flag itself is protected in a
  PasswordDB instance.
</p>

<p>
  PasswordDB exposes a simple JSON API. You just `POST` a payload of the form
  `{"password": "password-to-check", "webhooks": ["mysite.com:3000", ...]}` to
  PasswordDB, which will respond with a `{"success": true}"` or
  `{"success": false}"` to you and your specified webhook endpoints.
</p>

  <div class="bg-white rounded-t-lg border-t border-l border-r border-gray-400 p-4 mt-10">
    For example, try running:
  </div>
  <pre class="rounded-b-lg"><code class="language-bash">
$ curl &lt;%= url %&gt; -d '{"password": "password-to-check", "webhooks": []}'
</code></pre>

<p>
  In PasswordDB, the password is never stored in a single location or process,
  making it the bane of attackers' respective existences. Instead, the password
  is "chunked" across multiple processes, called "chunk servers". These may live
  on the same machine as the HTTP-accepting "primary server", or for added
  security may live on a different machine. PasswordDB comes with built-in
  security features such as timing attack prevention and protection against using
  unequitable amounts of CPU time (relative to other PasswordDB instances on the
  same machine).
</p>

<p>
  As a secure cherry on top, the machine hosting the primary server has very
  locked down network access. It can only make outbound requests to other
  local servers. As you learned in Level 5, someone forgot to internally firewall
  off the high ports from the Level 2 server. (It's almost like someone on the
  inside is helping you &mdash; there's an [sshd][1] running on the Level 2 server
  as well).
</p>

<p>
  NB: During the actual Stripe CTF, the Level 8 server could access all high TCP
  ports on the Level 2 server, and the Level 2 server was running an SSHD. This is
  also the case in this VM where both tests are on the same machine.
</p>

<p>
  To maximize adoption, usability is also a goal of PasswordDB. Hence a launcher
  script, `password_db_launcher`, has been created for the express purpose of
  securing the Flag. It validates that your password looks like a valid Flag and
  automatically spins up 4 chunk servers and a primary server.

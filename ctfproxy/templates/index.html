  <p>In 2012, Stripe hosted a web security capture the flag game. Each level contained a security flaw that could be exploited to progress. It was a neat way for web developers to learn about some of the most common web security flaws from the perspective of a determined attacker.</p>
  <p>Luckily, when the servers were taken offline, Stripe open sourced the levels for the challenge. This project brings it back to life by containerizing each level with docker, orchestrating the services with Docker Compose, and managing access, game state, and this website with a reverse proxy written in Go.</p>
  <p>Enjoy!</p>

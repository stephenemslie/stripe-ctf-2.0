  WaffleCopter is a new service delivering locally-sourced organic waffles hot
  off of vintage waffle irons straight to your location using quad-rotor
  GPS-enabled helicopters. The service is modeled after [TacoCopter][1], an
  innovative and highly successful early contender in the airborne food delivery
  industry. WaffleCopter is currently being tested in private beta in select
  locations.
